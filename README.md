# Running the Game
The easiest way to run the game is to download the "Tetros-19.0-amd64.msi" file and run the installer. Install the game into the desired location, then locate the Tetros.exe file to run the game.

It is also possible to download the build.zip, then unzip the file and navigate to build\exe.win-amd64-3.5\Tetros.exe. From there, just run the Tetros.exe.

In order to run the game from source code, download all files into a directory and then run Tetros.py (includes new features such saving/loading game functionality) or Tetros Original.py (the original version).
